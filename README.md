# hostFileUpdater

An application to compose and check host file.

The host file may be composed from a header (comment), plus a base host file. Then the localhost mappings are added 
(including all the dynamic IPs). And more importantly, you may compose your host file from a set IP/hostname mappings
and easily switch between different mappings.

Conflicts are highlighted. And you can check if the hosts are reachable.
